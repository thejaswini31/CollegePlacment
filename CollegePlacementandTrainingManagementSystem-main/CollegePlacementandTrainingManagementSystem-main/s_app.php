      <p> The placement process is the process by which a recruiter helps a client fill 
      one of its open positions through the successful matching of the job’s
       requirements to what a potential candidate offers in the form of skills.
      </p>

      <h3><b>Student's Data Preparation</b></h3>
      <p> During sixth semester, all the students are informed to enter their details
        as per the format supplied to them. The department coordinator in turn 
        validates the data of each and every student of their department. The final
         data sheet of each department is submitted to the placement cell. 
         The placement cell consolidates the data sheet of all the branches.
          The student’s data sheet is updated by entering the result of the previous
           semester.</p>

      <h3><b>Drive Process:</b></h3>
  <p> Human Resource from the respective companies inform the placement cell well in
 advance. Based on the requirement of the company, we prepare the circular
  mentioning the eligibility criteria and the essential details to students.
   This circular is brought to the notice of each and every student and finally 
   displayed in the concerned department notice board.</p>

   <h3><b>Following are the events during the day of placement drive:</b></h3>
   <ol type="1">
     <b>
      <br>
      <li>Pre placement talk</li>
      <li>Aptitude test</li>

<h3><b>Eligibility Criteria:</b></h3>
<br>
<li>General eligibility criterion for most of the companies is aggregate of 60% or 
6.75 CGPA, i.e., your average percentage score in all semesters.</li>
<li>However, some companies like Quickcilwer, Xoriant, Teksystem, Microsoft… demand 
a 7.75 CGPA aggregate. So it is advisable to score at least above 6.75 CGPA right 
from the first semester and above 7.75 CGPA for better opportunities.</li>
<li>Another important criterion is that students should not have any backlogs.
Although a few companies may allow up to ONE backlog. A handful of companies
 do not tolerate any backlogs at all.</li>
